### What is *Robust* Photometric Stereo?

Conventional Photometric Stereo is based on least-square regression (or L2 residual minimization),
This software implementation also includes a conventional L2 residual minimization (or least-squares) method.

Input | Ground Truth | L2 | L1 | SBL | RPCA
### How to use?

Download this package and run the demo code:
To switch the solver, look into `demo.py` and choose any of the following one when calling `RPS.solve()`

	RPS.L2_SOLVER    # Conventional least-squares

### What is Photometric Stereo?

Photometric Stereo is an approach to determining surface normal of
a scene from a set of images recorded from a fixed viewpoint but under
varying lighting conditions, originally proposed by Woodham [1].

### What is *Robust* Photometric Stereo?

Conventional Photometric Stereo is based on least-square regression (or L2 residual minimization),
which is susceptible to large *outliers*. For example, when a Lambertian reflectance and local illumination model
are assumed, specular high-lights and cast shadows are regarded as outliers, causing inaccurate estimates of
surface normal.

<img src="./specular.gif" width="256"> &rarr; <img src="./L2_specular_normal.png" width="256">
</p>

Robust Photometric Stereo effectively disregards such outliers based on *sparse* regression.
This code implements robust photometric stereo based on:
* L1 residual minimization
* Sparse Bayesian learning
* Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA)

This software implementation also includes a conventional L2 residual minimization (or least-squares) method.

### Dependencies
The code is written in Python 3.6 but should be able to adapt it to Python 2.x if needed.
You might need the following Python packages installed:
* `cv2` (OpenCV, used for image I/O)
* `glob` (used for reading out a list of images)
* `numpy` (main computation depends on matrix operations)
* `sklearn` (scikit-learn, used for normalization of array)
